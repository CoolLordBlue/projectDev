   <p>This website was built by me from scratch using HTML and CSS. It's hosted on GitHub Pages</p>
   
   <p> My aim with this website was to find a fun way to 
        learn a bit more about building a website while also having something I could show others as proof of what I have accomplished so far.</p>
        
   <p>As you may have noticed, the design of this website is a bit simplistic and minimal. This is on purpose, as I believe that websites 
        should be able to run on any hardware regardless of its age. Websites like YouTube and Reddit have nice designs that work well on 
        newer machines, but are very slow and responsive on older hardware (especially compared to old Reddit and classic YouTube) </p>
